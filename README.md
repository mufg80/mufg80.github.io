# ePortfolio - Shannon Musgrave

Welcome to the repository for my ePortfolio, created as part of the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University. This ePortfolio showcases my technical skills, professional growth, and ability to design and implement computing solutions across key computer science domains: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

## Overview

This repository hosts the static website for my ePortfolio, accessible at mufg80.github.io. The ePortfolio highlights three enhanced artifacts, each demonstrating proficiency in a critical area of computer science, along with a code review video, comprehensive documentation, and a professional self-assessment. These components collectively reflect my ability to solve complex problems, apply industry-standard practices, and communicate effectively with diverse audiences.

## Key Features

Software Design and Engineering: Enhanced a C++ console application into a C# WPF GUI application using the MVVM pattern, with improved security, data persistence, and user experience.

Algorithms and Data Structures: Optimized a C++ vector-based application by implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient dynamic insertions, with rebalancing and recursion.

Databases: Upgraded an Android mobile application to integrate a remote Microsoft SQL Server via a RESTful service, with user-specific queries and enhanced security measures.

Professional Communication: Includes tailored documentation, UML diagrams, and a code review video to support technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Code Review: Available at YouTube.
