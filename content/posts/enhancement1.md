## C# GUI Implementation



<!--more-->


The artifact for this enhancement was developed in CS 410 Software Reverse Engineering. It is a console application that was reverse-engineered and translated into C++ source code earlier this year. The application was designed for an investment company and managed five client accounts, each classified as either a retirement or brokerage. It used a single, hardcoded password embedded in the binary. Upon launch, the application required authentication and would be terminated if the correct password was not provided. Once authenticated, a menu allows users to list accounts, change investment options, or exit the program.
This artifact was chosen for enhancement due to its significant potential for improvement. The original application was limited to five hardcoded accounts and a single administrator, lacking features such as adding or removing users or accounts, data persistence after program closure, and encryption. Additionally, converting the console-based application into a graphical user interface (GUI) was a compelling reason for its selection, as this would make the application more appealing and accessible to modern users. These shortcomings made the artifact an excellent candidate for the software design and engineering category.
The enhancement process demonstrated several software development skills by requiring the deconstruction of the application's functionality and its translation into a new programming language and application type. The console application was transformed into a C# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop application. The original console menu was replaced with visual elements displayed in a window, and each functionality was translated and improved. For example, user authentication was previously reliant solely on a hardcoded password, now it incorporates both a username and password. The password is hashed using the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) algorithm and encrypted with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and saved to the hard disk for persistence. Similarly, account management was enhanced by replacing the five hardcoded accounts with the ability to create, delete, and modify accounts, which are also encrypted and saved to the disk for persistence. Furthermore, the application was restructured from a single-script artifact into the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, commonly used in WPF applications. This architecture separates concerns among the view (user interface), the view model (intermediary), and the model (business logic), facilitating easier development, testing, and maintenance. In summary, the enhancements improved user experience, security, persistence, and functionality.
The goal of this project was to meet the course outcome: "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)." This was achieved through several key improvements aligned with industry standards and modern software engineering practices. First, transitioning from a console-based application to a C# WPF application with a GUI showcased the use of tools like XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) to enhance user experience and meet contemporary expectations. Adopting the MVVM architecture further demonstrated sound software design principles, promoting maintainability, testability, and scalability through the separation of concerns.
Second, implementing advanced security measures, such as SHA-256 password hashing and AES encryption, addressed the need for securing data at rest. These enhancements ensure that sensitive data, including authentication credentials and account information, are protected, aligning with industry standards for secure software solutions. Third, adding data persistence through disk storage and enabling the creation, deletion, and modification of accounts significantly increased the application's value. These features transformed the original artifact from a limited program with hardcoded accounts into a dynamic, user-friendly system capable of meeting real-world investment company requirements. This demonstrated the ability to design and implement a database-like solution supporting flexible and persistent account management. Overall, the enhancements improved functionality and usability while directly addressing the course outcome by leveraging industry-standard tools, innovative techniques, and skills to deliver a valuable solution.
The enhancement process was more complex than initially anticipated. Rather than simply translating the program from C++ to C#, the application underwent a fundamental transformation. Unlike a console application that runs sequentially in a loop, the enhanced application creates hundreds of objects and employs callbacks, data binding, and other mechanisms to connect use cases while maintaining a responsive user interface. Unforeseen challenges arose during development, including encryption issues, input validation, and missing properties. For instance, a new property, IsAdmin, had to be added to the user model to restrict account addition and removal to a single administrative account. Input validation to enforce unique usernames was overlooked initially and had to be added later. The most challenging aspect was serializing two data structures, a list of accounts and a list of users, into a single string for storage. Key lessons learned included working with declarative markup languages for the views, implementing data binding and events in the view models, and mastering encryption and serialization in the models.
