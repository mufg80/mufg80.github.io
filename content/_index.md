## **Self Assessment**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing my coursework at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in showcasing my strengths, refining my professional goals and values, and enhancing my employability in the computer science field. As a Digital Services Technologist, my journey began with coding as a hobby, which unexpectedly opened the door to my current role. Enrolling at SNHU allowed me to formalize and expand my skill set, equipping me with both technical expertise and soft skills critical for success in the industry. The coursework introduced me to new technologies and programming paradigms, deepening my understanding of computer science concepts. Beyond technical skills, I honed essential abilities in writing, communication, and collaboration, which have been vital in my professional growth. These skills have strengthened my ability to learn quickly, troubleshoot effectively, and apply foundational knowledge to real-world challenges, making me a more valuable asset in my current role and preparing me for future opportunities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific experiences throughout my program have significantly shaped my capabilities. For instance, studying reverse engineering provided critical insights into how programming languages translate into machine instructions, enabling me to identify vulnerabilities like hardcoded passwords. Exploring machine learning opened my eyes to innovative problem-solving approaches, moving beyond explicit instructions to leveraging data-driven pattern recognition. Additionally, learning Agile software development and Scrum methodologies emphasized the importance of disciplined development practices, from gathering accurate requirements through stakeholder interviews to delivering user stories efficiently. These experiences, combined with practical applications outside my ePortfolio, have reinforced my ability to tackle complex problems with a structured, industry-aligned approach.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My coursework also developed my proficiency across key computer science domains: collaboration, communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. As a hobbyist coder, I worked independently, writing code spontaneously. However, my degree program taught me the importance of collaboration in team environments, requiring clear and tailored communication to succeed. For example, in my UI/UX design course, I interviewed my daughter, mother, and a colleague to gather feedback on an application. Each provided unique perspectives, highlighting the need to adapt communication methods for different stakeholders. In technical domains, I gained critical insights:

- **Security**: Reverse engineering revealed how easily exploits, such as hardcoded passwords, can be uncovered. I learned to adopt a defense-in-depth approach, incorporating principles like least privilege and trust boundaries to bolster application security.

- **Software Engineering**: I realized that functional code is not the sole objective. Employing industry-standard practices, design patterns, and reliable libraries produces testable, readable, and maintainable code that aligns with professional expectations.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Studying Big-O notation helped me understand the trade-offs of various structures and algorithms, enabling me to select optimal solutions for specific problems.

- **Databases**: I gained an appreciation for the complexity of databases beyond simple serialization, learning the importance of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties to ensure reliable data management.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These skills collectively form a robust foundation, preparing me to address diverse challenges in the computer science field.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three artifacts in my ePortfolio cohesively demonstrate the breadth of my technical abilities and align with the lessons learned throughout my program. Together, they illustrate my capacity to design, evaluate, and implement innovative computing solutions while adhering to industry standards.

- **Artifact 1**: I transformed a C++ console application into a C# GUI application using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. This enhancement included adding encryption, persistence, and advanced functionality. By presenting this project to stakeholders during development, I employed strategies to gather feedback from diverse audiences, ensuring the solution aligned with organizational needs and supported decision-making. The accompanying documentation was clear, technically sound, and tailored to both technical and non-technical audiences, demonstrating my ability to communicate effectively in professional contexts.

- **Artifact 2**: I converted a C++ console application using a vector for sorting into a Binary Search Tree optimized for dynamic insertions. By designing a custom tree with O(log n) insertion performance and managing rebalancing trade-offs, I demonstrated my ability to evaluate and design solutions using algorithmic principles. I collaborated with peers to refine the design, fostering a collaborative environment that incorporated diverse perspectives to enhance the solution’s effectiveness. The visual and written explanations of the tree’s trade-offs were adapted for technical audiences, ensuring clarity and precision in communication.

- **Artifact 3**: I enhanced an Android mobile application by integrating a remote Microsoft SQL Server database via a RESTful API, replacing its SQLite database. I developed a C# RESTful service, implemented a toggle for switching between local and remote databases, and secured the connection with an API key and SQL login for restricted access. This project required collaboration with team members to define API requirements, enabling organizational decision-making by aligning the solution with stakeholder needs. The technical documentation and oral presentations delivered during the project were professional, coherent, and tailored to both developers and project managers, showcasing my ability to communicate complex concepts to varied audiences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, these artifacts reflect my technical proficiency, problem-solving capabilities, and commitment to producing high-quality, industry-standard solutions. They also demonstrate my ability to foster collaborative environments that support organizational decision-making in computer science and deliver professional-quality communications that are coherent, technically sound, and audience-appropriate. These artifacts serve as a testament to my readiness to excel in the computer science field, whether by advancing in my current role or pursuing new opportunities.
