## **Self Assessment**

{{<paragraph>}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing my coursework at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in showcasing my strengths, refining my professional goals, and enhancing my employability in the computer science field. As a Digital Services Technologist, my journey began with coding as a hobby, which unexpectedly opened the door to my current role. Enrolling at SNHU allowed me to formalize and expand my skill set, equipping me with both technical expertise and soft skills critical for success in the industry. The coursework introduced me to new technologies and programming paradigms, deepening my understanding of computer science concepts. Beyond technical skills, I honed essential abilities in writing, communication, and collaboration, which have been vital in my professional growth. These skills have strengthened my ability to learn quickly, troubleshoot effectively, and apply foundational knowledge to real-world challenges, making me a more valuable asset in my current role and preparing me for future opportunities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific experiences throughout my program have significantly shaped my capabilities. For instance, studying reverse engineering provided critical insights into how programming languages are translated into machine instructions, enabling me to identify vulnerabilities like hardcoded passwords. Exploring machine learning opened my eyes to innovative problem-solving approaches, moving beyond explicit instructions to leveraging data-driven pattern recognition. Additionally, learning Agile software development and Scrum methodologies emphasized the importance of disciplined development practices, from gathering accurate requirements through stakeholder interviews to delivering user stories efficiently. These experiences, combined with others, have reinforced my ability to tackle complex problems with a structured, industry-aligned approach.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My coursework also developed my proficiency across key computer science domains: security, software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. As a hobbyist coder, I worked independently, writing code spontaneously. However, my degree program taught me the importance of collaboration in team environments, requiring clear and tailored communication to succeed. For example, in CS-319 UI/UX Design and Development, I interviewed my daughter, mother, and a colleague to gather feedback on an application. Each provided unique perspectives, highlighting different parts of the application that stood out to them, illustrating the need to adapt communication methods for different stakeholders. In technical domains, I gained the following insights:

{{<bullet2>}} 

Databases: I gained an appreciation for the complexity of databases beyond simple serialization, learning the importance of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties to ensure reliable data access and manipulation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three artifacts in my ePortfolio cohesively demonstrate the breadth of my technical abilities and align with the lessons learned throughout my program. Together, they illustrate my capacity to design, evaluate, and implement innovative computing solutions while adhering to industry standards.

Artifact 1: I transformed a C++ console application into a C# Graphical User Interface (GUI) application using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. This enhancement included adding encryption, persistence, and advanced functionality. I created strategies to communicate with diverse audiences, to ensure the solution aligns with organizational needs and decision-making. The accompanying documentation was clear, technically sound, and tailored to both technical and non-technical audiences, demonstrating my ability to communicate effectively in a professional context.

Artifact 2: I converted a C++ console application using a vector for sorting into an application using a Binary Search Tree (BST) optimized for dynamic insertions. By designing a custom tree with O(log n) insertion performance and managing rebalancing trade-offs, I demonstrated my ability to evaluate and design solutions using algorithmic principles. I also implemented collaborative methods that will help me to succeed in a diverse environment and created visual, written, and oral explanations of the applications abilities.

Artifact 3: I enhanced an Android mobile application by integrating a remote Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) Server database via a Representational State Transfer (RESTful) service, in addition to its SQLite database. I implemented a toggle button for switching between local and remote databases and secured the connection with an Application Programming Interface (API) key and SQL login for restricted access. A project of this scope would require collaboration with team members and so several strategies were implemented to succeed in a team environment. The technical documentation and oral presentations delivered during the project were coherent and tailored to both developers and project managers, showcasing my ability to communicate complex concepts to varied audiences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, these artifacts reflect my technical proficiency, problem-solving capabilities, and commitment to producing high-quality, industry-standard solutions. They also demonstrate my ability to foster collaborative environments that support organizational decision-making in computer science and deliver professional-quality communications that are technically sound and audience specific. These artifacts serve as a testament to my readiness to excel in the computer science field, whether by advancing in my current role or pursuing new opportunities.
